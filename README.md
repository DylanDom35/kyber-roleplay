Kyber Roleplay Framework

A semi-serious Star Wars-inspired roleplay gamemode for Garry's Mod, designed to support immersive characters, faction-driven politics, and a modular design philosophy.

⚠️ A Message to Early Cloners

To everyone who cloned this repo early: Thanks for your interest in Kyber!

Please note that what you have is a very early, incomplete version of the framework. Many core systems are either missing or still under heavy development. This current state is not representative of the final product, and running the gamemode as-is will lead to bugs, missing features, and incomplete functionality.

We originally made the code public to showcase progress and invite collaboration—but to prevent confusion and premature public releases, the repository was temporarily pulled back.

🔓 The good news: Kyber is—and always will be—intended for free public release once it reaches a stable and complete state.

If you're here to test, learn, or give feedback, welcome aboard. If you're hoping for a plug-and-play RP framework, we ask for your patience as we finalize development.
